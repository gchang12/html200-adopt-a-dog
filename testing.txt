TESTING
=======
Testing visibility of all elements.
Testing functionality of all buttons.

Firefox
-------
### Testing visibility of all elements
1. Toggle on `Responsive Design Mode`; navigate the following path.
    1. `More tools`
    2. `Responsive Design Mode`
*Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Shift-M`.*
2. Open the web-dev console; navigate the following path..
    1. `More tools`
    2. `Web Developer Tools`
*Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Shift-I`.*
3. Select a viewport size corresponding to that of a phone.
4. Hover over the HTML source rendered in the web-dev console.
5. For each element in the body you hover over, ensure that a part of the rendered page is highlighted. This ensures that every HTML element that is supposed to be visible is in fact visible.
   - Enable `touch simulation` as necessary to scroll to the bottom of the page.
   - Toggle the orientation of the virtual viewport and check for visibility there also.
6. If any element is not rendered, amend the HTML as necessary.
7. Repeat steps 3 -- 6 for all pages, and for at least three viewport sizes. Sizes corresponding to viewports from all of these categories must be included:
   - phone
   - tablet
   - PC
### Testing functionality of all buttons.
1. Add following JS code to the bottom of all HTML pages.
```javascript
  for (const button of document.body.querySelectorAll("button")) {
    button.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
      alert(event.target.innerText);
    });
  };
```
2. Open each page and check that clicking on each button causes an alert pop-up to display the name of the button clicked.
3. Repeat step 2 for all pages.

Chrome
------
### Testing visibility of all elements
1. Open the `Developer tools`; navigate the following path.
    1. `More tools`
